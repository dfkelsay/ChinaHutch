I created a 'gofundme' campaign to try and earn money for my bf and his roommates whom lost some of there things in a
house fire which took place at their clean and sober residency. 1.people would be supporting others who are trying to
live a better life for themselves and their community, 2.there were actually posessions which these men worked hard for 
that were lost, 3.who doesn't feel good after giving...well, I know I do.

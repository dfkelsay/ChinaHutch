So, I like the idea that a collaborated bunch talk about helpful tips and experiences of appearing at DefCon. 
I could see how intimidating something like this would be. OMG! The thought of getting in front of all those people 
and presenting something which seems so complex to me, is pretty nerve racking. I would think this would be a fun place
to share interests of this type of thing. Way to be about what you like!
